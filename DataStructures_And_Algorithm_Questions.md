- [ ] Q1: implementing hashtable 
 - Ans: Open Hashing, Scparate chaining

- [ ] Q2: Why is worst case complexity of hash tables O(n)? 
 -  Ans: if the hashing function calculates many of the positions in the same spot given the input data (hashing clashes), then the O(1) startsto creep closer to O(N).

- [ ] Q3: array vs linkedlist vs hash map. When would you choose what?
 -  Ans: Array, list have order maintaed facilitating looping. Hash map is not ordered. Iteration can be complicated (NR)
 
- [ ] Q4: Simulation, Random, Seed (IoT project related)  

- [ ] Q5: Truely singleton and efficient design in multithreaded scenario. 
 - Ans:double null check, ine inside the lock , one outside on the volatile instance, etc) OPTIMISTIC RETRYING
 
- [ ] Q6: Checked Exceptions v/s unchecked.

- [ ] Q7: TreeMap v/s HashMap
