- [ ] Q1: implementing hashtable 
- [ ] Q2: Why is worst case complexity of hash tables O(n)? 
- [ ] Q3: array vs linkedlist vs hash map. When would you choose what?




Ans: Open Hashing, Scparate chaining
Ans: if the hashing function calculates many of the positions in the same spot given the input data (hashing clashes), then the O(1) startsto creep closer to O(N).
Ans: Array, list have order maintaed facilitating looping. Hash map is not ordered. Iteration can be complicated (NR)
